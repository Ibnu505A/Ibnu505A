# 👋 Hi, I'm Ibnu

Thanks for stopping by!

I'm currently focused on building mobile applications using **React Native**, especially for education, productivity, and AI-powered tools. I love crafting clean UIs and making sure the app feels smooth and responsive — both in design and performance.

I'm also actively learning about **Artificial Intelligence**, including **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and how they can be integrated into mobile applications. Besides that, I'm diving into the world of **Web3** and decentralized apps — really curious how these technologies will shape the future.

Right now, I spend most of my time coding, learning, and experimenting with ideas that I hope will be useful for others (and fun to build too).
